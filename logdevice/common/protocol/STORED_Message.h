  // PREEMPTED    if rid.epoch was already sealed by some sequencer
  // NOSPC        if the partition of local log store is out of disk space
  // NOTINCONFIG  if the node id that the node that got the STORE believes to
  //              be its current identifier in the cluster did not
  //              appear in the copyset of the STORE. This status is reported
  //              only if STORE was sent directly rather than through a chain.
  // SHUTDOWN     storage node is shutting down and not accepting any more work
  // NOTSTORAGE   this is not a storage node
  // FORWARD      this node received a chained STORE but was not able to forward
  //              the STORE to the next node in the chain. The Appender can
  //              assume that all nodes in the chain after this node will not
  //              successfully store a copy. When chaining is enabled, the
  //              Appender may receive two STORED messages from a node to which
  //              it sent a STORE, one with E::FORWARD and another one for the
  //              store operation it performs locally.
  // REBUILDING   copyset intersects with recipient node's view of rebuilding
  //              set.
  //              If there are multiple such nodes, it may take multiple waves
  //              for the sequencer to blacklist them all. This check is
  //              disabled for records/holes stored by recovery
  //              (STORE_Message::WRITTEN_BY_RECOVERY flag);
  //              TODO (#10343616): bypassing the check for recovery stores is
  //                                not fully correct.
  // CHECKSUM_MISMATCH
  //              if the STORE failed checksum verification, either this or
  //              sequencer node seem to have corrupted it, likely due to bad
  //              hardware or bug. Appender will determine which node caused
  //              this. It's also possible that the STORE was malformed due to
  //              a bug, in which case this node will be blamed as corrupting
  //              stores and be graylisted. Either case will set off an alarm
  //              and should be investigated by the oncall.
