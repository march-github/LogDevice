// Sender was able to release a registered message to the Connection without

// priority class.
STAT_DEFINE(deferred, SUM)
// Sender was unable to direct dispatch a registered message, but a bandwidth
// available callback was provided. The callback will be registered
// (cbregistered stat will be incremented too) but this message will likely
