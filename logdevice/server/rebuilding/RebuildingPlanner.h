/**
 * RebuildingPlanner is responsible for retrieving a RebuildingPlan for each log
 * on each local donor shard.
 *
 * A RebuildingPlan is the set of epoch ranges that the ShardRebuilding state
 * machine on each shard will be responsible for rebuilding.
 *
 * This state machine starts off retrieving the LSN up to which the log has to
 * be rebuilt using SyncSequencerRequest. This state machine also uses the
 * WAIT_RELEASED and WAIT_PURGED arguments of SyncSequencerRequest has we don't
 * want the local shard to touch records that belong to unclean epochs and/or
 * have not been purged by purging.
 *
 * In order to retrieve the set of epochs that will need to be rebuilt, this
 * state machine reads the metadata log of the data log. For each epoch, we
 * check whether the storage set intersects with the rebuilding set. If it does
 * not, the epoch is not added to the plan.
 *
 * We then find the list of local shards that should be donors by looking if
 * they belong to the storage set.
 *
 * This state machine is also responsible for determining if the current
 * rebuilding is authoritative or not. An authoritative rebuilding is a
 * rebuilding that guarantees that all records will be left sufficiently
 * replicated when it completes. If replication factor is 3 and 3 or more shards
 * spanning more than 3 nodes are in the rebuilding set, then we know that
 * rebuilding is not authoritative. The event log state machine uses this
 * information to make decisions on when to transition a shard's authoritative
 * status to AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY.
 *
 * ## A note about Flexible Log Sharding
 *
 * Currently RebuildingCoordinator runs one RebuildingPlanner per local shard.
 * This is due to the current architecture allowing one separate rebuilding
 * state machine per shard offset (all nodes in the cluster currently have the
 * same number of shards). With FLS, we want to make it possible to have
 * heterogeneous number of shards in the cluster, or we want to make it possible
 * for a storage set to contains more than one shard per node.
 * In order to support that, RebuildingCoordinator will be changed such that it
 * runs one and only one RebuildingPlanner, and the resulting plan is used to
 * define which logs are rebuilt by which local shards.
 *
 * The interface of RebuildingPlanner is compatible with that. Currently
 * RebuildingCoordinator only uses RebuildingPlanner for the set of logs that
 * are for a specific local shard according to getLegacyShardIndexForLog().
 * Then, RebuildingCoordinator asserts that the resulting plan only contains
 * entries for that shard.
 * In the future, RebuildingCoordinator will run only one RebuildingPlanner for
 * all shards at the beginning of rebuilding.
