/**
 * @file Manages reading and shipping a batch of records for one read stream
 *       that is catching up. For an explanation of "catching up", see doc for
 *       ServerReadStream::isCatchingUp(). This class is responsible for
 *       advancing ServerReadStream::read_ptr and
 *       ServerReadStream::last_delivered_record_ as records are shipped to the
 *       client.
 *
 *       Reading from the local log store can be done on the worker thread if a
 *       non blocking read can be performed, or on a separate pool of storage
 *       threads so that worker threads don't block on I/O. To do so,
 *       CatchupOneStream provides two methods read() and onReadTaskDone().
 *       The former will try to read some records without blocking. If more
 *       records can be read but reading them would block, read() will create a
 *       storage to be executed by a storage thread and return
 *       Action::WAIT_FOR_STORAGE_TASK. The user is then expected to call
 *       onReadTaskDone() with the storage task upon completion.
