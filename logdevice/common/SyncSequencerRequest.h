/**
 * @file SyncSequencerRequest.h
 *
 * SyncSequencerRequest is a Request used to synchronize with the Sequencer of a
 * log. It's basically a utility that wraps GetSeqStateRequest with a retry
 * mechanism with exponential backoff.
 *
 * Can be used in two ways:
 *  1. As a fire-and-forget request. Post it to Processor as a regular Request.
 *     The SyncSequencerRequest will be automatically deleted after callback
 *     has been called.
 *  2. As an owned state machine. Call start() to start the state machine on
 *     current worker. Destroy the SyncSequencerRequest, on the same worker,
 *     to cancel it. Destroying from inside the callback is ok.
 *
 * The completion callback provides a `next_lsn` which provides the following
 * guarantees if the GSS merge type is GSS_MERGE_INTO_NEW:
 *
 * 1/ `next_lsn` is greater than the LSN of any record written prior to issuing
 *    the request. As such SyncSequencerRequest can be used for causal
 *    consistency, ie if you start a reader to read up to lsn `next_lsn-1` you
 *    are guaranteed that this reader will read any record written prior to
 *    issuing the request and won't block waiting for new records to be
 *    appended to the log. The reader may still block while recovery releases
 *    all records up to `next_lsn-1` for delivery;
 * 2/ If flags::WAIT_RELASED is used, all records up to LSN `next_lsn-1` are
 *    guaranteed to be released for delivery at the time the callback is called.
 *    Note that it doesn't guarantee that a ClientReadStream will be able to
 *    read them immediately: if the sequencer crashes before propagating the
 *    release to all nodes, reader may need to wait for a new sequencer to
 *    finish recovery and do another release.

   * @param status
   *   - E::OK: On success.
   *   - E::CANCELED: If isCanceled() is implemeted by a base class and returned
   *     true before this request could complete.
   *   - E::ACCESS: If sequencer node denied us access.
   *     If complete_if_access_denied_ is true, ACCESS is returned right away.
   *     If complete_if_access_denied_ is false, SyncSequencerRequest keeps
   *     trying until timeout expires (and if timeout is inifinite, ACCESS error
   *     is never returned).
   *   - E::NOTFOUND: If complete_if_log_not_found_ is true, NOTFOUND is
   *     returned if a sequencer node says that the log is not in config.
   *     complete_if_log_not_found_ is false, we keep trying until timeout
   *     expires and then return FAILED.
   *   - E::INVALID_PARAM: If prevent_metadata_logs_ is true, and the provided
   *     log ID is a metadata log, immediately complete with this status.
   *   - The following errors can be returned after timeout expires. If timeout
   *     is infinite, these error codes are not used:
   *      -- E::TIMEDOUT: We could not get successful a reply from a sequencer
   *         in time. If WAIT_RELEASED is used, this can also mean that we timed
   *         out before the Sequencer finished recovering all records up to LSN
   *         `next_lsn`.
   *      -- E::CONNFAILED: Unable to reach a sequencer node.
   *      -- E::NOSEQUENCER: Failed to determine which node runs the sequencer.
   *      -- E::FAILED: Sequencer activation failed for some other reason e.g.
   *         due to E::SYSLIMIT, E::NOBUFS, E::TOOMANY(too many activations).
   *         If complete_if_log_not_found_ is false, FAILED is also returned if
   *         the log is not in config.
   *
   * param  seq      NodeID that runs the sequencer.
   * @param next_lsn All records up to next_lsn-1 are guaranteed to be released
   *                 for delivery. And any record that was written prior to
   *                 issuing the SyncSequencerRequest are guaranteed to have
   *                 LSN < next_lsn.
   * @param tail_attributes   set as pointer to sequencer's tail attributes if
   *                          sequencer finished recovery and
   *                          INCLUDE_TAIL_ATTRIBUTES was set. nullptr otherwise
