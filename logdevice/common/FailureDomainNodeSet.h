/**
 * @file FailureDomainNodeSet maintains a list of shards that can be tagged with
 * an attribute, and provides an API for querying the replication properties of
 * the subset of shards with a certain values for this attribute, given a
 * replication requirement across several failure domains.
 *
 * This utility provides 2 important methods:
 *
 * - canReplicate   Used to check if it would be possible to replicate a record
 *                  on the subset of shards that have certain values for the
 *                  attribute. For instance, if the replication requirements
 *                  include 3-way replication across the NODE scope and 2-way
 *                  replication across the RACK scope, this function will return
 *                  true if 3 shards have the required value for the attribute,
 *                  and these 3 shards span 2 racks and 3 nodes.
 *
 * - isFmajority    Used to check if enough shards have certain values for the
 *                  attribute so that that set of shards is an f-majority for at
 *                  least one of the scope for which there is a replication
 *                  requirement. For instance, with 3-way(NODE) / 2-way(RACK)
 *                  replication requirements, this function would return true if
 *                  there are only 2 nodes that don't have all their shards
 *                  tagged with the required value, or if there is only 1 rack
 *                  that does not have all its shards tagged with the required
 *                  value.
 *                  An example usage of this method is EpochRecovery which tags
 *                  each shard with "SEALED" if that shard has been sealed.
 *                  EpochRecovery is able to now it can proceed past the sealing
 *                  stage if it has sealed an f-majority of shards.
 *                  Another example usage is ClientReadStream which uses this
 *                  method to determine if a record with a given LSN exists or
 *                  not. When a storage shard indicates that it does not have a
 *                  copy of that record, it is tagged with a value. Given that
 *                  a record is considered to not exist if it is not properly
 *                  replicated, ClientReadStream will keep waiting for more
 *                  shards to chime in until it gets an f-majority of shards
 *                  tagged with the value.
 *
 * In addition to being able to tag a shard with a value, it is possible to tag
 * it with an AuthoritativeStatus, which is a special attribute that indicates
 * what is expected of this shard regarding its replication status. If the shard
 * is tagged with AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY for instance, this means it is known to
 * not have data. If the set of shards spans 4 racks and the replication
 * at RACK level is 2, we usually need to have all shards in (4-2+1)=3 racks to
 * be tagged in order to have an f-majority. However, if all shards in one of
 * the racks are AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY, we only need 2 racks.
 * @see logdevice/common/AuthoritativeStatus.h for more information on
 * AuthoritativeStatus.
 *
 * Internally, this class maintains one object `ScopeState` for replication
 * scope. This object keeps track of the list of domains at that scope as well
 * as a mapping from ShardID to the domain it belongs to. This object also
 * contains some metadata computed on the fly as we tag shards with new
 * attributes or change their authoritative status. For instance, we keep track
 * of:
 * - how many domains in that scope are empty, ie all their shards are
 *   AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY;
 * - Which domains in that scope have at least one shard tagged with each
 *   value (useful for `canReplicate`);
 * - How many domains in that scope have all their shards tagged with a value
 *   (useful for `isFmajority`).
 *
 * Complexities:
 * - Tagging a shard with an attribute is linear to the number of replication
 *   scopes;
 * - Changing the authoritative status of a shard consists of a number of
 *   operations equal to the number of replication scopes times the number of
 *   different values for the attribute currently in use;
 * - isFmajority is linear to the number of replication scopes;
 * - canReplicate is linear to the number of replication scopes when used with
 *   an attribute value, or O(num attrs * replication * num scopes) in the worst
 *   case if used with an attribute predicate.
