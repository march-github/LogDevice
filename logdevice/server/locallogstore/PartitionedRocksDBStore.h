/**
 * @file  PartitionedRocksDBStore (aka LogsDB) is a LocalLogStore implementation
 *        based on RocksDB, further partitioned by time.  This allows us to run
 *        with compactions disabled, therefore keeping write amplification
 *        minimal. Individual partitions are small in order to keep reads
 *        efficient (read performance depends on the number of L0 files).
 *
 *        Partitioning by time makes trimming efficient -- it amounts to just
 *        dropping a partition. To reclaim space faster when logs have different
 *        backlog durations, compactions of individual partitions are also
 *        supported.
 *
 *        Internally each partition is a separate column family. There's also
 *        a special metadata column family that, in addition to log metadata
 *        such as trim points, stores a directory that's used to determine
 *        which partition some (logid, lsn) pair maps to.
 *
 *        Partitions have non-overlapping ranges. Therefore, read iterators
 *        always visit one partition at a time.

    // API expects all input CFData to have some dirty data. The input vector
    // needs to be sorted in order of column family creation time. The policy
    // consider the families at lower index in the array as low priority, hence
    // if a column family memtable needs to stay in memory longer it needs to be
    // located more towards the end of the array.
    // 1. Divide the cf in two classes. One is for older cf and
    // other is for younger cf.
    // 2. Memory needs to be flushed if total active memory usage goes beyond
    // trigger. Find how much memory has to be flushed by calculating the
    // difference between active memory usage and low watermark. If none
    // then we are looking for other triggers like idle, old data and max
    // memtable size.
    // 3. Selection amongst old cfs is done by sorting cf's in ascending order
    // of first dirtied time. Here we priortize flushing by oldest data first.
    // 4. Go over the sorted elements in order till we reach low watermark
    // memory usage. If there are cf with memtables over max size, add them to
    // flush candidates regardless.
    // 5. After processing, if the target memory usage is unreached
    // start processing latest cf's. Process the latest partititons
    // ordered by biggest memtable first. Add flush candidates
    // till either we reach target usage or we run out of cf to process.
    // Again if there are cf above max memtable size then add them to
    // flush candidates regardless.
    // 6. It can happen that low watermark size is not reached as nothing can be
    // selected that fits the criteria. Higher layers take decision about
    // whether there is a need to stall writes.
    //
    // Other things we tried in past that didn't help:
    // * Flush the biggest memtable instead of the oldest. If you keep doing
    // that, you end up with lots of small active memtables occupying most of
    // the memory budget but never getting flushed.
    // * For deciding when to flush, look at the total size of not just active
    // memtables but all memtables, including memtables that are being flushed
    // (let's call them "immutable" from now on) and memtables that were flushed
    // but are pinned by iterators (let's call them "pinned"). If there are
    // enough pinned memtables to get us over threshold even with no active
    // memtables, we start flushing like crazy, making things even worse.
    // * Same but don't count pinned memtables, only active and immutable. Has
    // the same problem.
    // * Same but only flush if total size of active memtables is at least half
    // the threshold. This works ok, but doesn't seem to much advantage over
    // just looking at active memtables only. Worst-case memory usage seems to
    // be 2x the threshold in both cases (worst case for the active+immutable
    // approach is: start empty, write up to threshold, start a flush, write up
    // to half threshold, start another flush, write almost up to half threshold
    // before first flush completes). Worst steady-state memory usage seems 25%
    // better. We decided it's not worth the trouble for now.
