/**
 * @file Contains the logic of the Single Copy Delivery (SCD) optimization
 *       that makes it possible to receive only one copy of each record, saving
 *       network bandwidth and CPU.
 *
 *       When SCD is active, storage shards only send records for which they are
 *       the primary recipient in that record's copyset, causing each record to
 *       be sent once (assuming the record's copyset is equal in each copy).
 *
 *       @see doc/single-copy-delivery.md for more information about scd and
 *       how storage shards decide whether or not to send a copy.
 *
 *       This class contains the logic for failover mechanisms of the SCD
 *       optimization, which is always triggered by the client.
 *       We maintain a list of filtered out ShardIDs that we send to the storage
 *       shards via the START message. This list is used by the shards to know
 *       which shards are filtered out, and to send the records those shards
 *       were supposed to send if they are next in the copyset.
 *
 *       The filtered out list is formed of two sublists:
 *       - the shards down list contains shards that the client knows are down;
 *       - the shards slow list contains shards that are much slower than the
 *         others, and by filtering them out we can failover to a healthier
 *         shard;
 *
 *       There are different failover and recovery scenarios that we handle:
 *
 *       1. Immediate failover to ALL_SEND_ALL due to missing records.
 *          checkNeedsRewindIfEveryoneSentGapOrIsFilteredOut() is the method
 *          that verifies if there is a reason to immediately switch to
 *          ALL_SEND_ALL mode. This function is called each time a gap or record
 *          is received. If at some point the number of shards that can't send
 *          next_lsn_to_deliver_ is measured to be equal to readSetSize(), we do
 *          the failover because this means that the storage shard that is
 *          supposed to send next_lsn_to_deliver_ does not have it or thinks
 *          it's not supposed to send it.
 *
 *      2. Rewinding the stream due to some connection failures.
 *         When ClientReadStream determines that a storage shard cannot send us
 *         its records, it calls addToShardsDownAndScheduleRewind(). This
 *         function ensures we soon rewind the stream with that shard in the
 *         filtered out list. ClientReadStream calls
 *         addToShardsDownAndScheduleRewind() when:
 *         - It could not send START because sendStartMessage() failed;
 *         - A shard sent STARTED with status=E::AGAIN or an unexpected status;
 *         - The socket to a storage shard was closed.
 *
 *      3. Immediate primary failover due to checksum fail.
 *         If we receive a record with a checksum fail, ClientReadStream calls
 *         addToShardsDownAndScheduleRewind() similarly.
 *
 *      4. Immediate primary failover due to a shard rebuilding.
 *         If we receive a STARTED(status=E::REBUILDING), ClientReadStream calls
 *         addToShardsDownAndScheduleRewind() similarly.
 *
 *      5. Optional primary failover due to a slow shard. If a shard (or set of
 *         shards) is slower at completing windows that all the other shards,
 *          we will add it to the shards slow list and rewind the stream.
 *          @see ClientReadStreamFailureDetector.
 *
 *      6. Failover to ALL_SEND_ALL because we are stuck:
 *         In rare cases where we can not make progress for some time and there
 *         are too many shards that are stuck, we failover to ALL_SEND_ALL mode.
 *         The `all_send_all_failover_timer_` timer takes care of detecting
 *         that.
 *
 *      7. Recovery to SCD:
 *         When in ALL_SEND_ALL mode, we switch back to SCD when the window is
 *         slid.
 *
 *      8. Removing shards from the shards down list.
 *         When a shard sends a record, ClientReadStream calls
 *         scheduleRewindIfShardBackUp() which checks if the shard is in the
 *         shards down list but has been sending records not in an
 *         under-replicated region. If that's the case, a rewind is scheduled to
 *         remove the shard from the shards down list.
 *
 *      9. Removing shards from the shards slow list.
 *         Shards will be removed from the slow shards list if we need to add
 *         another shard to the filtered out list, and we can't do that without
 *         the filtered out list satisfying the replication requirements. When
 *         this happens we will remove from the list the oldest slow shard
 *         We don't actively remove from the slow shards list whenever we detect
 *         that shards stop being slow because this can cause ping-ponging
 *         between adding/removing the shard from the list and thus doing
 *         unnecessary rewinds.
