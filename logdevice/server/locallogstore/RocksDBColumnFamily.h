  const std::unique_ptr<rocksdb::ColumnFamilyHandle> cf_;

  // Writes by LogsDB into any column family update metadata column family as
  // well. For correctness, it is necessary to persist metadata cf updates
  // before corresponding writes in a column family. This data structure
  // tracks current active memtable and metadata column family memtable which
  // contains the corresponding updates. The flushing mechanism uses this data
  // to figure out if metadata memtable needs to be flushed and flushes the
  // memtables in the right order.
  //
  // Flusher needs to select memtables to flush and make sure the dependency
  // does not change through the flushing activity. To ensure this, decisions to
  // flush and invocation of rocksdb flush api is done from single thread. The
  // rocksdb flush implementation marks current memtable as immutable and
  // creates a new empty memtable and makes it active for the column family. It
  // pushes the immutable memtable to background threads where they get
  // persisted. In order to ensure depdency does not change, this entire
  // procedure of marking immutable and switching needs to be done atomically
  // for a memtable and it's metadata dependency. Also background threads need
  // to make sure that metadata memtable need to persist first before dependent
  // memtable. RocksDB satisfies this requirement by providing Flush api that
  // accepts multiple column families and atomically switches memtables of all
  // the column families under the db mutex. RocksDB background threads satisfy
  // the requirement of flushing in order by supporting the atomic flush feature
  // where all memtables that were atomically switched together are persisted as
  // a single transaction.
  //
  // Each writer thread after finishing the write queries the current active
  // metadata memtable and marks it as a dependency. There are multiple writer
  // threads writing into same column family at a time. Decision to flush a
  // column family is taken from a separate thread dedicated for running the
  // flushing logic. Assume that MemtableTracker contains some metadata memtable
  // dependency, which already flushed. A new write is initiated for the column
  // family which updates active memtable and newly created metadata memtable.
  // Before the new dependency can be register flusher threads decides to pick
  // this column family for flushing and it queries the tracker for dependent
  // memtable. Flusher will see that the metadata memtable was already flushed
  // and this column family can be flushed solo. This is incorrect because
  // active memtable contains data which is dependent on a later metadata
  // memtable. To avoid this, when initiating write to a column family
  // active_writers_count in Tracker is incremented and it is decremented when
  // plugging in the metadata dependency. If flusher thread decides to flush a
  // column family with non zero writers it gets FlushToken_MAX as the dependent
  // memtable for the column family which indicates it to flush the latest
  // metadata memtable anyway. beginWrite and endWrite methods mark the
  // beginning and installation of dependency respectively.
